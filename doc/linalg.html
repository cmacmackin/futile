<A NAME="subroutine_linsolve"><H3>linsolve</H3></A>
<PRE>public subroutine linsolve (matrix, reval, vals)
    real(kind=8), intent(in), dimension(:,:) :: matrix
</PRE>
<DL><DD><DL><DD>
 A square, 2-dimensional array, which is the LU factorization of the 
 matrix containing the coefficients of the linear system to be solved.
</DL></DL>
<PRE>    integer, intent(out) :: reval
    real(kind=8), intent(inout), dimension(size(matrix,1)) :: vals
end subroutine linsolve
</PRE>
  Solves a system of linear equations using the (pre-computed) LU
  decomposition of the matrix describing the system. The decomposition can 
  be computed using the subroutine lu_decomp(), below.
<A NAME="subroutine_ls_fit"><H3>ls_fit</H3></A>
<PRE>public subroutine ls_fit (coeffs, lsval, order, reval, xvals, yvals)
    real(kind=8), intent(out), dimension(:) :: coeffs
</PRE>
<DL><DD><DL><DD>
 A 1-dimensional array with a length of at least 'order,' in which 
 the coefficients of the fit will be returned.
</DL></DL>
<PRE>    real(kind=8), intent(out) :: lsval
</PRE>
<DL><DD><DL><DD>
 The square difference values (error) of the fit.
</DL></DL>
<PRE>    integer, intent(in) :: order
</PRE>
<DL><DD><DL><DD>
 The order of the polynomial to be fit to the data.
</DL></DL>
<PRE>    integer, intent(out) :: reval
</PRE>
<DL><DD><DL><DD>
 The return code of the subroutine. A value of 0 indicates that the 
 subroutine executed as expected. A value of -1 indicates that the 
 matrix of coefficients passed to either linsolve() or lu_decomp() 
 was not square, as it should have been. A value of -2 indicates that 
 the coeffs array passed to ls_fit() is not large enough to hold all 
 of the coefficients for the desired fit. A value of -3 means that 
 there is insufficient data for ls_fit() to fit a  polynomial of the 
 desired order.

<PRE>    real(kind=8), intent(in), dimension(:) :: xvals
</PRE>
<DL><DD><DL><DD>
 A 1-dimensional array containing the independent variable.
</DL></DL>
<PRE>    real(kind=8), intent(in), dimension(:) :: yvals
</PRE>
<DL><DD><DL><DD>
 A 1-dimensional array containing the dependent variable.
</DL></DL>
<PRE>    ! Calls: linsolve, ludecomp
end subroutine ls_fit
</PRE>
  Finds the least-square polynomial fit for a set of data.
<A NAME="subroutine_lu_decomp"><H3>lu_decomp</H3></A>
<PRE>public subroutine lu_decomp (matrix, reval)
    real(kind=8), intent(inout), dimension(:,:) :: matrix
</PRE>
<DL><DD><DL><DD>
 A square, 2-dimensional array, which is to be factored. The 
 factorization is returned within this matrix as well. The diagonal 
 of ones in the upper triangular matrix is not explicitly 
 represented, as the values of these elements are known.
</DL></DL>
<PRE>    integer, intent(out) :: reval
</PRE>
<DL><DD><DL><DD>
 The return value of the subroutine. A value of 0 indicates that the 
 subroutine executed as expected. A value of -1 indicates that the 
 matrix of coefficients passed to either linsolve() or lu_decomp() 
 was not square, as it should have been. A value of -2 indicates that 
 the coeffs array passed to ls_fit() is not large enough to hold all 
 of the coefficients for the desired fit. A value of -3 means that 
 there is insufficient data for ls_fit() to fit a polynomial of the 
 desired order.

<PRE>end subroutine lu_decomp
</PRE>
  Performs LU decomposition on the provided square matrix.
